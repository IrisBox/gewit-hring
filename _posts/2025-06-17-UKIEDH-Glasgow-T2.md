### Notes
The dérive took place over 90 minutes. Each iPad used [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) to track the routes the teams took and record this as GPS data. These can be seen in the interactive map above. The digital resources, in a wide variety of different media and collections, and the observations collected by the participants, which mostly consists of photographs and a couple of videos, are all mapped on, and can be explored using, the interactive map in the [final report](https://gewit-hring.com/journal/ukiedh-glasgow/), and is also (hosted at [irisbox.github.io/UKIEDH-Derive](https://irisbox.github.io/UKIEDH-Derive/)), which uses the [Peripleo](https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/Peripleo.html) tool. The photos are [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) *Level 0* compliant, hosted using the [IIIF Workbench](https://github.com/glenrobson/github_iiif), and can also be browsed where they are hosted on GitHub at [https://irisbox.github.io/Derive-Glasgow/](https://irisbox.github.io/Derive-Glasgow/).
