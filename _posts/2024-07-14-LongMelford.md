> *“On the Green at Long Melford are three great elms, probably U. procera. About 5ft diam. Two are probably over 100ft high.”*
> [Oliver Rackham, Notebook 112, 1967 (CCCC14/6/2/1/112)](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-CCCC-00014-00006-00002-00001-00112/36) 

### 1) 
As above, so below?

![Image: Three square black and white photos of plants arranged in an "L" shape, repeated three more times, increasingly smaller, creating a sense of perspective.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-01.jpg)

A fresh young [Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak) leaf emerging, graceful [Common water-plantain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisma_plantago-aquatica), and a [white waterlily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaea_alba) flower reflecting in stillness.

### 2) 
Form and texture.

![Image: Four square photos of flowers, arranged together in a square. The top left is a black and white photo of a cushion-like scabious, the bottom right is a black and white photo of a spiky globe thistle, and the other two are photos of yellow yarrow flower heads, one more open than the other.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-02.jpg)

A soft pillowy [yellow/cream scabious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabiosa_ochroleuca) cushion, two yellow flower heads of [yarrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achillea_ageratum), and a spiky [globe thistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinops_ritro).

### 3) 
Jewelled reflections. 

![Image: Four square photos of flowers, arranged together in a square. The four photos are repeated and overlain twice, each increasingly smaller towards the centre. The top left is a stained glass window detail of an elaborated decorated and jewelled dress. The top right photo is a detail of a chess/chequer board with black squares alternating with ones comprising of mosaic pieces of mother of pearl. The bottom left photo shows some long grass/reeds reflected in a water surface. The bottom right photo shows a bright blue and black striped dragonfly resting on a reed.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-03.jpg)

### 4) 
Selective focus. Reflections and ripples. 

![Image: Two black and white photos of the same scene arranged one above the other. The scene shows two of Melford Hall's turrets and flag pole reflected in the surface of the pond -  The upper photo is focussed on the reflection, the lower is focussed on the water surface, which has ripples and a pond skater.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-04.jpg)

### 5) 
What goes up, must come down/upstairs downstairs.

![Image: A black and white photo showing a variety of different carved forms of baluster in a single banister. The image is reflected horizontally, and repeated once vertically.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-05.jpg)

### 6) 
Still we see clearly, we clearly still see.

![Image: Two black and white photos, one above the other. The top image shows part of a glass/crystal chandelier. The cut edges of the pieces are clean and clear, but the light shows up some chipped edges. The lower image shows a close-up of the part of a drinking glass where the stem meets the bowl. The reflected and refracted light on the form of the glass creates a sense of vibrating motion, even though the glass is still.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-06.jpg)

### 7)  
Inside Out, outside in.

![Image: A background photo of a bright purple pyramidal orchid flower is overlain by two additional smaller photos in the top-left and bottom-right quarters. The top-left image shows a gatekeeper butterfly feeding from a yellow hawkweed flower. The butterfly has orange wings edged with brown, and has a distinctive black spot with two white "pupil" markings on each forewing, and the petals of the flowers is each tipped with five lobe shaped scalloped edge, resembling very tiny flattened marigold washing up gloves. The bottom right image shows a wooden chair in front of some period interior wall mouldings, the chair has been elaborately decorated with finely detailed marquetry in floral and foliage designs, the chair splat additionally features an urn design at the base and a small bird in the upper centre.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-07.jpg)

Atop a luminous [pyramidal orchid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacamptis_pyramidalis), a beady-eyed [gatekeeper butterfly](https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/invertebrates/butterflies/gatekeeper) feeds from washing-up glove flowers - [hawkweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hieracium) - and nature enshrined in marquetry casts a shadow on the wall from the window light.  

### 8) 
Floral forms.

![Image: Three square photos arranged in a backwards "L" shape. They are repeated three more times, each increasingly smaller towards the top left corner, creating a sense of perspective. The photo in the top right is black and white, and shows a circular carved stone moulding that consist of concentric layers of foliage that increasingly swirl towards the edge. The photo in the bottom right corner of the arrangement shows a close-up of a soft pink rose flower from an angle. The bottom left photo is a black and white close-up photo of the same rose flower, but directly on, emphasising its circular form and swirling petal arrangement and somewhat mirroring the form of the stone moulding.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-08.jpg)

### 9) 
A refracted exterior, an invitation in. 

![Image: Two colour photos, with a similar colour palette, arranged one above the other. The top photo appears blurred, but it has been taken through an old window pane with an uneven surface and the image focus is on the surface of the glass, which creates an effect similar to a reflection in rippling water. The forms not in focus suggest a red brick building and some large rounded areas of foliage. The bottom photo is centred on a flight of steps that lead up and directly through an open doorway of an old red brick banqueting house that has many gables and small chimneys. The straight bright green grass path that leads up to the building is flanked on either side by neat rows of tall and tightly clipped darker green conifer trees.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-09.jpg)

### 10) 
Two sentinels. 

![Image: Two black and white photos side by side, each of a different dead tree. The trees are still standing but have had most of their branches removed. In the background are the tops of some living trees on the horizon and the sky with wispy clouds. Each photo is reflected by a direct copy below it, creating an effect that makes the dead trees appear to be isolated and floating in the sky, adding to a sense of their suggestive anthropomorphic forms.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-10.jpg)

> *“Few elms remain alive in the area of Melford Hall.”*
> [Oliver Rackham, Notebook 239, 1977 (CCCC14/6/2/1/239)](https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-CCCC-00014-00006-00002-00001-00239/18) 

### 11) 
In search of the elms.

Before setting off, I'd searched the web for "elm trees Long Melford" and luckily one of the first returned results was a painting called [Long Melford Green on a Frosty Morning, Suffolk](https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O18366/long-melford-green-on-a-watercolour-badmin-stanley-roy/) by the artist [Stanley Roy Badmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Roy_Badmin) that is in the collections of the V&A.

<p align="center"><iframe src="https://fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/uv.html#?manifest={{ page.manifestTwo }}&c=0&m=0&cv=0&config=&locales=en-GB:English (GB),cy-GB:Cymraeg,fr-FR:Français (FR),pl-PL:Polski,sv-SE:Svenska&r=0" width="90%" height="500" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

I could try to find the site of the elm trees and see if any evidence of them remains?

![Image: Three colour photos arranged in a square, there are two smaller square photos, above which is a wider image. The upper image shows the northern end of Long Melford's village green, which has a pub and row of houses leading into the distance where there is a church tower and a grander brick building (an old hospital). The grassed area of land nearest the buildings is used as a car park. The bottom-left photo shows a closer view of the car park, with the hospital, church and houses in the background. In the foreground, the surface level of the ground is very uneven. The bottom right image shows a piece of worn/rotten wood, which is riddled with insect holes, lying on some grass.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-11.jpg)

There is a suspiciously uneven area of ground in the otherwise smooth grassed village green which, on my initial reading of Badmin's painting, is tantalisingly in the area that the trees might have once stood so proudly. There is even a large lump of light coloured worn and rotten wood that is riddled with insect holes ... had I found a piece of one of the trees?
