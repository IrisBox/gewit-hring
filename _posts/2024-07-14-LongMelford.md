[Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/en/) App, a citizen science project, identifies the tree as [*Catalpa bignonioides*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalpa_bignonioides).

On 31 May 1874, William Thiselton-Dyer wrote to Charles Darwin to share some observations of the movement of plants. Fellow botanist Thomas Meehan had recently observed movement of the stigma lobes in Catalpa flowers manually stimulated by a syringing technique.

Perhaps a victim of recent climate variations - a long dry summer and a long wet spring?

Even the plants growing up the wall look similar ~200 years later:

- [Anglesey Abbey: 1000611](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000611) was also owned by [Thomas Hobson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobson_(postal_carrier)), and George Jenyns, father of naturalist [Leonard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Jenyns), who was a correspondent with Charles Darwin and brother-in-law to John Stevens Henslow. So there are several relevant nodes of connection.

![Image: One of the new varieties in the Rose Garden. Each of four flowers in the photo is at a different stage of opening. The colour of the flowers ranges from a soft dark baby pink, through a very pale pink, to a peachy yellow, and in form from a tight rose shape to a loose, many petaled ruffle.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-07.jpg)

A herm, visually quite similar to the head of roses(?!), the curls of hair and petals - a perfectly sized snail nestles in a nook, pretending to be an earring or a curl of hair.
