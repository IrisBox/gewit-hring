[Pl@ntNet](https://plantnet.org/en/) App, a citizen science project, identifies the tree as [*Catalpa bignonioides*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalpa_bignonioides).

On 31 May 1874, William Thiselton-Dyer wrote to Charles Darwin to share some observations of the movement of plants. Fellow botanist Thomas Meehan had recently observed movement of the stigma lobes in Catalpa flowers manually stimulated by a syringing technique.

Perhaps a victim of recent climate variations - a long dry summer and a long wet spring?
