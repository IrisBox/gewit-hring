### 1) 
As above, so below?

![Image: Three square black and white photos of plants arranged in an "L" shape, repeated three more times, increasingly smaller, creating a sense of perspective.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-01.jpg)

A fresh young [Oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak) leaf emerging, graceful [Common water-plantain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alisma_plantago-aquatica), and [white waterlily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaea_alba) reflecting in stillness.

### 2) 
Form and texture.

![Image: Four square photos of flowers, arranged together in a square. The top left is a black and white photo of a cushion-like scabious, the bottom right is a black and white photo of a spiky globe thistle, and the other two are photos of yellow yarrow flower heads, one more open than the other.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-02.jpg)

A soft pillowy [yellow/cream scabious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scabiosa_ochroleuca) cushion, two yellow flower heads of [yarrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achillea_ageratum), and a spiky [globe thistle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinops_ritro).

### 3) 
Jewelled reflections. 

![Image: Four square photos of flowers, arranged together in a square. The four photos are repeated and overlain twice, each increasingly smaller towards the centre. The top left is a stained glass window detail of an elaborated decorated and jewelled dress. The top right photo is a detail of a chess/chequer board with black squares alternating with ones comprising of mosaic pieces of mother of pearl. The bottom left photo shows some long grass/reeds reflected in a water surface. The bottom right photo shows a bright blue and black striped dragonfly resting on a reed.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-03.jpg)

A stained glass window detail of an elaborated decorated and jewelled dress, a mother of pearl chess/chequers board, long grass/reeds reflected in a water surface, and a dragonfly resting on a reed.

### 4) 
Selective focus. Reflections and ripples. 

![Image: Two black and white photos of the same scene arranged one above the other. The scene shows two of Melford Hall's turrets and flag pole reflected in the surface of the pond -  The upper photo is focussed on the reflection, the lower is focussed on the water surface, which has ripples and a pond skater.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-04.jpg)

![Image: A view from inside the circle of Oak structures on which people can lean back and look up at the sky, which are surrounded by small trees and shrubs. There are several different cloud types in the sky.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-05.jpg)

![Image: A painting of Anglesey Abbey by Richard Relhan looks very similar to how it still looks today - a priory converted into a Jacobean style house around 1600.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-06.jpg)

Even the plants growing up the wall look similar ~200 years later:

![Image: One of the new varieties in the Rose Garden. Each of four flowers in the photo is at a different stage of opening. The colour of the flowers ranges from a soft dark baby pink, through a very pale pink, to a peachy yellow, and in form from a tight rose shape to a loose, many petaled ruffle.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/20240714-LongMelford/20240714-LongMelford-07.jpg)
