### 2) Lie of the land (Walk 1) (02/07/24)
It was late and dark by the time I got to the apartment yesterday, so didn't wander far, just to find a meal and get some supplies. After getting up and feeling a bit more relaxed, I thought I'd go for my first wander to see the sea and stroll along the promenade a while. My phone seemed to be confused about where I was, thinking I was in Beirut international airport for some reason.

### 6) (Walk 2)
Just the 305 miles in 37min 36sec today... So it turns out that apparently Israel are intermittently scrambling the gps signals to make it difficult for anyone to target them?! The rest of the librarians were all equally confused, but someone had a connection who knew what was going on.

### 9) (Walk 4) (06/07/24)
I had a bit of time before having to set off, so I wanted to head a bit further down the waterfront to the small area of sandy beach. Whilst on the beach, I took the opportunity to create a cyanotype reflecting on my time in Limassol. Whilst the sun worked its magic walking up and down in the shorline was lovely, it felt wonderful on my feet after a couple of days wandering around in my sandals, they were tired and achey.

### 11) A Re-reading
A recording of my conference paper created after the event. I find, when presenting, that my mind is so in the moment that the memory of what was said easily fades. A copy of the presentation can also be found here: 10.5281/zenodo.12704347 (Along along with others from the conference in the LIBER 2024's Zenodo community - https://zenodo.org/communities/liber2024).
