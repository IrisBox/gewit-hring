A recording of my conference paper created after the event. I find, when presenting, that my mind is so in the moment that the memory of what was said easily fades. A copy of the presentation can also be found here: 10.5281/zenodo.12704347 (Along along with others from the conference in the LIBER 2024's Zenodo community - https://zenodo.org/communities/liber2024).
