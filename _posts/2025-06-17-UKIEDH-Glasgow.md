***What Can Glasgow teach us?***   
***A collaborative d√©rive for the hybrid age.***  

### Introduction
Language, walls and screens are boundaries, our experience of them is a way to cross their thresholds. This hybrid d√©rive, undertaken on 17/06/2025 as part of the [UK-Ireland Digital Humanities Association's 2025 Annual Event](https://digitalhumanities-uk-ie.org/2025-annual-event/), was proposed as a way to question the theme of ‚ÄúCollaboration Beyond Boundaries‚Äù, seeking evidence of what we could learn or glean from the city of Glasgow. Its intention was to enable an embodied way to creatively explore, experience, discuss and answer this question, calling on participants to collaborate by applying their own skills, experience and background.
 
A d√©rive, defined by Guy Debord and the Situationist International in the 1950s, is a psychogeographical method of journeying through a landscape, and is characterised by transience, the varied ambience of the situation, and playfully constructive behaviour.[^2] Glasgow is no stranger to this concept ‚Äì in the 1990s a group of artists and activists, the [‚ÄòWorkshop for Non-Linear Architecture‚Äô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop_for_Non-Linear_Architecture), applied this theory as they undertook a 'Psychogeographical Survey of Glasgow'.

The general dominance of images in contemporary culture, in particular through the digitisation of cultural artefacts, offers opportunities to re-contextualise and re-connect to physical reality, disrupt traditional concepts of space and time,[^3] and create the conditions that afford a fresh perspective of the d√©rive.   

After a brief introduction, participants were split into teams, each tasked with exploring a different location and gathering as much evidence of their experiences and findings as they can before returning to reconvene at the venue for the conference Plenary Session. Each team was assigned an iPad to use and a nearby area, provided with access to a pool of digital resources that relate to the city of Glasgow, as well as some suggested themes and challenges as prompts, and given access to a shared space to gather their evidence.  

The rest was down to them!  

### Locations
- Team 1 set out east to Kelvingrove Park
- Team 2 made their way south to Riverside and Govan Footbridge
- Team 3 went north to Kibble Palace in Glasgow Botanic Garden 
- A fourth team was planned to explore the Glasgow Subway. **[NB]** This ended up impractical in the time available, but I have collected additional points of data and images from over the course of the conference which attest to this mode of transport that is so iconic to Glasgow.  

### Results
The d√©rive took place over 90 minutes. Each iPad used [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) to track the routes the teams took and record this as GPS data. These can be seen in the interactive map above. The digital resources, in a wide variety of different media and collections, and the evidence collected by the participants, which mostly consists of photographs and a couple of videos, are all mapped on, and can be explored using, the interactive map below using the [Peripleo](https://britishlibrary.github.io/locating-a-national-collection/Peripleo.html) tool. The photos are [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) *Level 0* compliant, hosted using the [IIIF Workbench](https://github.com/glenrobson/github_iiif), and can also be browsed where they are hosted on GitHub at [https://irisbox.github.io/Derive-Glasgow/](https://irisbox.github.io/Derive-Glasgow/). **[NB]** I'm still trying to figure out how to display the GPS route data in the Peripleo tool.

### The Challenges
Each team was provided with a selection of pre-existing digital resources, as well as a variety of challenges as prompts. These challenges were conceived to encourage closer reading of their surroundings, as well as to encourage them to use and situate the digital resources as a method of augmenting that experience. The number of challenges far exceeds what could be feasible in a timeframe of 90 minutes to intentionally heighten the role of chance in which the teams were drawn to undertaking on their specific d√©rive. The challenges are all listed below to assist in interpreting the resulting evidence, but I also hope other's might find inspiration and give them a go!    

**General (All Teams)**
- **Colours, Words & Palimpsests:** 
	- At all times, keep your eyes peeled for things that the city is telling you which might answer our question? ‚Äì remember to take photos! 
	- Which colours dominate your journey? 
	- Can you collect all the colours of the rainbow?
	- What official or unofficial words and palimpsests (eg the [‚ÄòPeople Make Glasgow‚Äô](https://tangentgraphic.co.uk/work/people-make-glasgow) slogan or graffiti)   
	
- **Traffic Coning:** The [statue of Wellington riding his horse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue_of_the_Duke_of_Wellington,_Glasgow) in the centre of Glasgow is world famous ‚Äì it was once listed in Lonely Planet‚Äôs ‚ÄòTop 10 most bizarre monuments on Earth‚Äô! This is not due to Wellington‚Äôs fame, but for the Glaswegian expression of humour and spirit in placing a traffic cone on his head. Instructions: 
	- Each teams iPad has a 3D model of a traffic cone already in the [Scaniverse App](https://scaniverse.com/). 
	- Open the app and go to the ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù and select the traffic cone.
	- Select ‚ÄúAR View‚Äù and you will be able to situate the model in augmented reality.
	- You can adjust the size and position ‚Äì use this feature to virtually place the cone on top of any statues you might encounter and remember to take a screenshot!  
	
- **The Joker: A game of incidental poker:** In the 1990s a group of artists and activists, formed the ‚ÄòWorkshop for Non-Linear Architecture‚Äô. They applied the theory of d√©rive as they undertook a 'Psychogeographical Survey of Glasgow'. One of the few literary relics of this survey is a report in a 1997 volume, edited by artist Stewart Home, about ‚ÄòThe Joker: A game of incidental poker‚Äô, an activity that centred on discarded playing cards that were found during their d√©rives.[^4] Instructions:
	- When you come across an interesting location(s), use the list of QR Codes that lead to digitised playing cards: [bit.ly/IncidentalPoker](http://bit.ly/IncidentalPoker)	
	- Anyone in the team who wants to, should select an example playing card and load its image on their mobile phone. 
	- Situate the mobile phone(s) in the location in any way that you wish and then take photo(s) using the Team iPad.

- **Contours, Currents & Vortexes:** ‚ÄúCities have psychogeographical contours, with constant currents, fixed points and vortexes‚Äù.[^5] This quote is from Guy Debord‚Äôs ‚ÄòTheory of the D√©rive‚Äô. Instructions:
	- Look at this photo of Jamaica Street Bridge in Glasgow, taken sometime between 1880 and 1920. At first the street seems fairly empty, but zoom in to the three boys near the centre foreground and you might notice that there are many ghostly figures moving around them.  
	- How is the city of Glasgow moving in the area that you are exploring? What kind of movement is there ‚Äì people, cars, boats, planes, or what about wildlife or other nature? 
	- Try and take photo‚Äôs that convey this somehow.

- **üëÅiSpy:** Can you find‚Ä¶ 
	- Any ways to re-situate some of your teams Digital Resources?
	- Something old and new that echo each other juxtaposed? 
	- An example of nature and the built environment working together?
	- Something old and new that echo each other juxtaposed? 
	- Any places or social acts unite us?
	- An example of a collective endeavour?
	- Anything that connects you to the city, or connects Glasgow to the place you live?
	- Things that helped you find your way?
	- Any sounds that might define the location?
	- Anything that keeps you safe?
