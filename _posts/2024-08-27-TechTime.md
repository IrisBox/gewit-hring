As I arrived at work one Tuesday, I was starkly reminded that the adoption of technological advances [perhaps change is a better word?] is a more complex matter than we might expect, or like. 

"Better" technology is subjective, and the drive of individuation and personal choice keeps things interesting, keeps things going, and keeps things alive. 

Is the concept of obsolescence fundamentally flawed due to humanity's inclination, perhaps towards enchantment, or is it dependant on it?

The enduring relevance of history to culture and society is also as relevant to technology. Something that keeps cropping up, maybe one of the challenges to overcome, is that the adoption of technology is not evenly distributed.

The wide variety of timescales and resources at play create a complexity that might be better embraced than fought against.   

Keeping time might be important when it comes to finding longitude at sea, but is it as important in the digital ocean?
