An adventure seeking Wabi Sabi.

### An Introduction
In contemplating how digital collections relate to ideas of universality, complexity and perfection I wanted to read ['Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers'](https://leonardkoren.com/#/wabi-sabi-1/) by Leonard Koren. I couldn't find a copy in [Cambridge University Library](https://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/), and it felt incongruous to simply buy a copy online. So, I sought about turning this search for a book into a richer experience by visiting [Kettle's Yard](https://www.kettlesyard.cam.ac.uk/) to buy a copy in their shop. 

This time of year is the perfect opportunity to experience one of the great spring events in Cambridge - the wild flowers springing into life along Queen's Road and The Backs. There had been heavy rain, but a clear sunny day presented itself. As luck would have it, it was also the final day of ['Making New Worlds: Li Yuan-chia & Friends'](https://www.kettlesyard.cam.ac.uk/whats-on/making-new-worlds-li-yuan-chia-and-friends/), an exhibition at Kettle's Yard, which also presented an opportunity to contemplate my adventure through experiencing some art that introduced me to some more thought provoking and pertinent ways of working.
