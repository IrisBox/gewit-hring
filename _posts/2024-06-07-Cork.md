Cambridge -> Cork.

![Image: Four images capturing the journey from Cambridge to Cork. The top-left is a photo from the plane window as it taxi's to the runway, besides which there is green grass and a wind-sock blowing. The top-right image is a black and white photo taken from the plane window whilst flying over the River Severn. The Severn Bridge, the M4 Severn Crossing, and the centre line of the river as it meanders into the Bristol Channel have all been highlighted by overlaying thin white lines. The bottom-left image is a screenshot from Google Maps showing the location of the plane as it passes over the Pembrokeshire Coast in Wales and out over the sea towards Ireland. The bottom-right photo shows a view from the plane window of the first glimpse of green on the approach to the Emerald Isle.]({{site.url}}/images/posts/202406-CORK/CORK-01.jpg)
