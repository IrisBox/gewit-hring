A pilgrimage, of sorts, from Snape Maltings along the River Alde to Iken, and St Botolph's Church.

Grey and overcast, but peaceful and pleasant. 

An enchanting and timeless bleakness.

Spotted:   
A sea of waders, skipping, swooping and scouring.  
A seal on a sand bank, basking and lolling.  
A Barn Owl, keeping watch and hunting in the reeds.
