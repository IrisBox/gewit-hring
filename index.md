I wanted to try a new way of working. 
To create a space for myself to think.
A space to try. A space to document.

I was always terrible at making notes, and I’ve come to realise that perhaps that is not a reason not to try … and perhaps, it might even be interesting …

Please take a look at the [About]({{site.url}}/about/) page for further info about Gewit-Hring, or about [Andy Corrigan]({{site.url}}/andy-corrigan/). Or explore my [thoughts]({{site.url}}/blog/) and [walks]({{site.url}}/walks/), which may well cross paths and collide. 

### So, why Gewit-Hring?
Circularity has begun to underpin many avenues of my enquiry and several lines of thought are taking shape around and from it. 

Reflecting and routed in the significance of a mandala, in looking to my own future, I turned to the past and fumbled with some Old English with a mind to a journey, a ‘knowledge-circle’:
> **Gewit:** Knowledge / Understanding / Sense / Wits even.
> 
> **Hring:** Circle / Cycle / Circuit / Ring perhaps.

Thoughts expressed here are my own, and will by the nature of this site, be constantly developing and changing. I welcome any comments or suggestions.
